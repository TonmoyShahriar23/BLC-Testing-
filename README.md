# BLC: E-Learning Web Portal Testing Project

BLC is a comprehensive **manual web testing project** conducted on an educational Learning Management System (LMS).  
This project focuses on validating the **functional correctness, usability, and reliability** of the web portal used by students for academic activities.

The testing ensures that critical learning features work as expected and that users receive clear feedback during both valid and invalid actions.

The following core functionalities were tested:

- Login & Authentication  
- Dashboard  
- Course List  
- Course Content (Video, PDF, Lecture)  
- Assignment Submission  



## Scope of Testing

This project covers **manual functional testing** from a **student user perspective** and includes:

- Functional testing of core modules  
- Validation and negative testing  
- UI and usability testing  
- Authorization and access control checks  
- Bug identification and documentation  

The goal is to identify defects early and improve the overall user experience of the platform.

4. Execute test cases step by step  
5. Compare **Actual Result** with **Expected Result**  
6. Identify defects where behavior does not match expectations  
7. Record issues in the Bug Report document  


## Bug Reporting Process

All identified issues were documented using a structured bug report format that includes:

- Issue ID  
- Module Name
